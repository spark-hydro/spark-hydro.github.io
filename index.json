Semi-arid regions worldwide are expected to experience rising temperatures and lower precipitation, impacting water supply and spatio-temporal patterns of salinity loads and affecting downstream water quality. This study quantifies the impact of future climate on hydrologic fluxes and salt loads in the Gunnison River Watershed (GRW) (14,608 km2), Colorado, using the APEX-MODFLOW-Salt hydro-chemical watershed model and three different CMIP5 climate models projection downscaled by Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) for the period 2020–2099. The APEX-MODFLOW-Salt model accounts for the reactive transport of major salt ions (SO42−, Cl−, CO32−, HCO3−, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, and K+) to streams via surface runoff, rainfall erosional runoff, soil lateral flow, quick return flow and groundwater-stream exchange. Model results are analyzed for spatial and temporal trends in water yield and salt loading pathways. Although streamflow is primarily derived from surface runoff (65%), the predominant source of salt loads is the aquifer (73%) due to elevated concentrations of groundwater salt. Annual salt loading from the watershed is 582 Mkg, approximately 10% of the salt load in the Colorado River measured at Lee's Ferry, AZ. For future climate scenarios, annual salt loads from the watershed increased between 4.1% and 9.6% from the historical period due to increased salt loading from groundwater and quick return flow. From the results, applying the APEX-MODFLOW-Salt model with downscaled future climate forcings can be a helpful modeling framework for investigating hydrology and salt mobilization, transport, and export in historical and predictive settings for salt-affected watersheds.","tags":null,"title":"Quantifying climate change impacts on future water resources and salinity transport in a high semi-arid watershed","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Assessement of Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Groundwater/Surface Water Interactions and Solute Transports\n","date":1703980800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703980800,"objectID":"e310a7529d8647b9c31dd8df34dd8f76","permalink":"https://spark-hydro.github.io/project/2021-01-01-blm/","publishdate":"2023-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2021-01-01-blm/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by Bureau of Land Management (BLM), United States, 2017-2023","tags":["application","uncertainty","optimization"],"title":"Assessment of Water, Salt, Fire and Land Management in Colorado River Basin using APEX","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Assessement of Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Groundwater/Surface Water Interactions and Solute Transports\n","date":1703980800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703980800,"objectID":"203e7d2884e70c8d819362a6bed9c2cd","permalink":"https://spark-hydro.github.io/project/2024-01-01-rda-ghg/","publishdate":"2023-12-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2024-01-01-rda-ghg/","section":"project","summary":"Funded by Rural Development Administration of the Republic of Korea, 2023-2025","tags":["development","greenhouse gases"],"title":"Development of a Carbon Dynamics Model for Predicting GHG Emission and Sequestration in Croplands","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

DayCent is widely used to simulate SOC dynamics and soil trace gas fluxes in various ecosystems. In this study, we developed DayCent-CUTE (auto-Calibration, sensitivity, and Uncertainty analysis ToolSet) for conducting global sensitivity analysis (GSA), auto-calibration, and uncertainty analysis for the model. The tool encompassed a pair of GSA methods and two distinct parameter optimization methods. A collection of 30 field experiments, encompassing 212 combinations of management treatments and 581 SOC measurements, was divided into 18 sites for calibration and 12 sites for independent model evaluation. The posterior parameter distribution obtained from the auto-calibration process reduces the model bias and RMSE values, while the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and R2 values showed improvements. The DayCent-CUTE proves to be an efficient and flexible tool that enhances the applications of the DayCent model.","tags":null,"title":"DayCent-CUTE - A global sensitivity, auto-calibration, and uncertainty analysis tool for DayCent","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Park, S., Jeong, J., Motter, E., and Bailey, R"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1675209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675209600,"objectID":"3ac4ad3c4b2982b8aa8a88b98a3b4ad5","permalink":"https://spark-hydro.github.io/publication/2023-01-park_et_al/","publishdate":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-01-park_et_al/","section":"publication","summary":"High salinity mobilization and movement from salt-laden deposits in semi-arid landscapes impair soils and water resources worldwide.
